### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

 1. Show the gender distribution of employees in the company.
 2. Show the race/ethnicity distribution of employees in the company.
 3. What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
 4. How is the distribution of employees at headquarters compared to remote employees?
 5. How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
 6. What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
 7. Which department has the highest termination rate?
 8. What is the distribution of employees across locations by city and state?
 9. How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
